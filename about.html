  <h1 class="big thin">Saba Khalilnaji</h1>
I am a reccent UC Berkeley engineering graduate working in the bay area with a passion for robotics and technology. 
  Both of which, I hope, will make the world a better place. I thoroughly enjoy all aspects of engineering and try to achieve
  a level of comfort in mechanics, hardware, and software. Fitness and nutrition are also gravely important to me. My blog will feature posts related to any of the above. If you'd like to chat, you can <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#109;&#101;&#115;&#097;&#098;&#097;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email me</a> or visit my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/saba-khalilnaji/25/544/7a5">linkedIn profile</a>.
