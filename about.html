I am a reccent UC Berkeley engineering graduate working in the bay area with a passion for robotics and technology. Both of which, I hope, will make the world a better place. My mind is often iterating over solutions to random problems; how to automate my laundry, use my compost to charge my smartphone, or power the majority of my electrical needs from homemade wind turbines. I thoroughly enjoy all aspects of engineering and, as any true hobbyist roboticist, try to achieve a level of comfort in mechanics, hardware, and software. Fitness and nutrition are also gravely important to me as I believe in the age old notion that the body and mind must be trained equally well. My blog will feature posts related to any of the above. If you'd like to chat, you can <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#109;&#101;&#115;&#097;&#098;&#097;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email me</a> or visit my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/saba-khalilnaji/25/544/7a5">linkedIn profile</a>.
