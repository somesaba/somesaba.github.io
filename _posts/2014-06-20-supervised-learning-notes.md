title: "Supervised Learning Notes"

I recently started taking [Georgia Tech's Machine Learning course][GT] to evaluate their program while also getting a nice survey of Machine Learning. I am enjoying the class and wanted to post my notes; the content is structured as it is presented by the professors. I had originally started converting my google doc notes to the format my blog uses (markdown and LaTex) but it proved to be huge waste of time, so I just decided to integrate it below and provide a [link][link]. These notes are very high level and primarly serve as a reference. I've allowed people to comment on the google doc in case you find any errors :)
