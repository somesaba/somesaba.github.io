Hello everyone,

I have decided to start blogging and this is my first post! My blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages][3] with the [UP theme][4] for jekyll. My plan is to primarly post about my robotics/technology projects and my nutrition/fitness endeavors. Stay tuned for posts on an autonomous foosball-playing-robot that uses [reinforcement learning][1], how I plan to train/recover from my L4/L5 herniated disc, and my simple [iphone app][2] for tracking macronutrients.
